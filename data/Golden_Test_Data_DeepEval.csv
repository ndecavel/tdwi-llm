Factors necessitating this include the potential for surface contamination during storage and transport, as well as the need to maintain the integrity of the cleaned surface.

Specific steps involved in this process include:
1. Thoroughly cleaning the surface to remove any oil, grease, or contaminants in accordance with SSPC-SP1.
2. For galvanized metal, pre-treating with phosphoric acid or an etching solution, and potentially brush blasting if passivated.
3. For rusty galvanizing, performing Hand Tool Cleaning per SSPC-SP2.

114,114,Detail the surface prep protocols for optimizing paint adhesion on galvanized steel substrates.,,"For optimizing paint adhesion on galvanized steel substrates, follow these surface preparation protocols:

1. **Cleaning**: Solvent clean the surface according to SSPC-SP1 to remove oil and grease.
2. **Pre-Treatment**: Apply a phosphoric acid solution or a commercially-available etching solution for better adhesion.
3. **Handling Passivated Surfaces**: If the galvanized metal has been treated with chromates or silicates, brush blast according to SSPC-SP16 to remove these treatments.
4. **Rusty Surfaces**: For rusty galvanizing, perform Hand Tool Cleaning in accordance with SSPC-SP2.
5. **Priming**: Prime the area on the same day as cleaning with a suitable primer to ensure optimal adhesion. 

These steps help to ensure a strong bond and effective performance of the paint applied.","['  Allow to cure for 30 days. The pH must be 10 or \nlower prior to coating.

117,117,What multi-faceted strategies can ensure paint remains unaffected by freezing temperatures during application?,,"To ensure paint remains unaffected by freezing temperatures during application, consider the following strategies:

1. **Temperature Control**: Avoid applying paint in temperatures below 55°F. Always check the weather forecast to ensure conditions are suitable.

2. **Indoor Application**: If possible, perform painting indoors where temperatures can be more easily controlled and kept above freezing.

3. **Use of Space Heaters**: If painting in a garage or unheated space, use space heaters to maintain a warm environment.

4. **Check Product Specifications**: Ensure the paint you are using is rated for lower temperatures, as some formulations are designed to withstand cooler conditions.

5. **Timing**: Schedule painting projects for warmer months to avoid the risks associated with cold weather.
